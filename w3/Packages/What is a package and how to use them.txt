A package in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module.

Downloading a package is very easy.

Open the command line interface and tell NPM to download the package you want.
Example:
    download a package called "upper-case":

in cmd,
    C:\Users\Your Name>npm install upper-case

Now you have downloaded and installed your first package!

NPM creates a folder named "node_modules", where the package will be placed. All packages you install in the future will be placed in this folder

My project now has a folder structure like this:

C:\Users\kanishka\nodejs\upper-case  **not actual pwd

How to use a package?

Include the "upper-case" package the same way you include any other module:

a practical example is given in the demo_packages.js file
